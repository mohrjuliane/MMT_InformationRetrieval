# Setup

1. `npm install`
2. Download the [Simple Wikipedia Corpus](http://georgms.github.io/textsearch102/files/simple-wikipedia.zip) and extract
   it here.

# Implementation

1. Add your implementation in `searcher.js`.
2. Depending on your implementation the exact scores and total result count may differ, but the top results should stay
   the same. Adjust the expected scores and total result count accordingly in the tests.
3. Check that tests run successfully.
4. Format the code before committing your implementation to make the code easier to read.
5. Check that the build runs successfully on GitLab.

# Format code

```bash
npm run lint-fix
```

# Start CLI

```bash
npm run cli
```

# Run tests

```bash
npm run test
```
